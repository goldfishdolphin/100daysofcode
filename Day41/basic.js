// For the below tasks, use console.log to show the result of the following string combinations

// 1 - Add an exclamation mark to a string of 'hello' using concatenation
console.log("hello"+"!")

// 2 - Log your first name to the console using two concatenated strings; the capitalised first letter and the remaining letters
console.log("N"+"aureen")

// 3 - Combine the strings "good" and "morning". How can you ensure these are logged as separate words using concatenation?
console.log("good"+ " morning")
// 4 - Add a full stop to the sentence ""Good morning, class" the teacher said". How can you make sure that the speech marks are preserved?
console.log("\"Good morning, class\" the teacher said.")
// 5 - Log your age to the console in the following format: 'I'm *your age here* years old!'. Use a seperate string for each word. Think about how you can preserve the apostrophe and white spaces.
console.log("I"+ "'m " + 38 + " years " + "old!")

// Declare three variables initialised as the following values:
// your first name, your age, whether or not you've had breakfast
const firstName = "Naureen";
const age = 38;
const ifHadBreakfast = true;

// To make your code readable, consider meaningful names for these variables and adhere to the *camelCase* naming convention
// The values these variables will hold is never expected to change, what will be the most appropriate *declaration keyword* to utilise?
//const
// Now log your variables to the console
console.log(firstName);
console.log(age);
console.log(ifHadBreakfast);

// 1 - Declare a variable consisting of the concatenated strings "Hello" and "!"
const greeting ="Hello" + "!"

// 2 - Declare another variable consisting of the value held by the variable you just created and the string "How are you?" - remember to consider the spacing!
const greeting2 = greeting + " How are you?"
// 3 - Declare three variables each containing one of your favourite numbers

const favouriteNumber1 = 20
const favouriteNumber2 = 30
const favouriteNumber3 = 5
// 4 - Declare another variable containing the sum of your favourite numbers
const sumOfFavouriteNumbers= favouriteNumber1+favouriteNumber2+favouriteNumber3;

// 5 - Log each of your variables to the console - do they appear as expected?
console.log(greeting);
console.log(greeting2);
console.log(favouriteNumber1);
console.log(favouriteNumber2);
console.log(favouriteNumber3);
console.log(sumOfFavouriteNumbers);
