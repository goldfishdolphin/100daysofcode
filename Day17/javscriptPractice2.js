// For the below tasks, use console.log to show the result of the following string combinations

// 1 - Add an exclamation mark to a string of 'hello' using concatenation
console.log("hello"+ "!");
// 2 - Log your first name to the console using two concatenated strings; the capitalised first letter and the remaining letters
let A = 'Hello '+ "Naureen";
let B = A.toUpperCase();
console.log(B);

// 3 - Combine the strings "good" and "morning". How can you ensure these are logged as separate words using concatenation?
let C = "Good";
let D = "Morning";
console.log(C + " "+ D);
// 4 - Add a full stop to the sentence ""Good morning, class" the teacher said". How can you make sure that the speech marks are preserved?
let E = ' "Good morning, class" the teacher said.';
console.log(E);
// 5 - Log your age to the console in the following format: 'I'm *your age here* years old!'. Use a seperate string for each word. Think about how you can preserve the apostrophe and white spaces.
console.log("I "+ "am "+ 28+ " "+ "years "+ "old"+"!");
