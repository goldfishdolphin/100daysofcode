// Declare three variables initialised as the following values:
// your first name, your age, whether or not you've had breakfast

// To make your code readable, consider meaningful names for these variables and adhere to the *camelCase* naming convention
// The values these variables will hold is never expected to change, what will be the most appropriate *declaration keyword* to utilise?
const firstName = "Neena";
const yourAge = 28;
const breakfast = true;

// Now log your variables to the console
console.log(firstName);
console.log(yourAge);
console.log(breakfast);
